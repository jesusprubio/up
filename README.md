## Install

### Binary Release

You can manually download a binary release for Linux, OSX, Windows or FreeBSD
from the [releases](https://github.com/jesusprubio/up/releases) page.

### Go

Please notice `latest` will install the dev version.

```sh
go install -ldflags="-s -w" -v github.com/jesusprubio/up@latest
```

## Use

The default behavior is to verify all the [supported protocols](internal/protocol.go)
against a randomly selected [public server](internal/servers.go) for each one.

```sh
up
```
